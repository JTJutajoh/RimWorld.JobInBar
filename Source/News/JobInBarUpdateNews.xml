        <content>Tentatively updated for RimWorld 1.6. Please report any issues you find.
Previous problems with log spam and GUI elements interfering with vanilla UI should be resolved.
I removed the dependency for Fluffy's old colour picker mod and replaced it with the vanilla color picker, but it only allows predefined colors. For now the available colors are hard-coded.
There is also a new toggle in the bottom right buttons that hides all labels at once. Use this if you have a large colony and the number of labels is actually causing a performance problem, or if you just want to de-clutter.

NOTE: New fixes/improvements are ONLY for RimWorld 1.4-1.6. If you're still playing on 1.3 or earlier (why?) you should see no change.</content>
